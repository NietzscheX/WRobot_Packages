//Requirements:

-A fight class that is able to deal with at least two enemies at once
-Default range pull for any class besides Paladin
-Update your characters gear / spells / skills frequently, especially if playing Warrior & Rogue
-An advanced C# fight class for botting on Warrior, Rogue and Mage


//Important information:

-Hunters will stay in their belonging starting zone and grind their way to level 10, due to them performing awful without a pet. After they reached level 10, they do their pet quest and
tame their default pet (Dwarf: Boar, Nightelf: Cat). Don't forget to set up pet feeding, or it's going to run away quickly.
-Night Elfs
-DO NOT abandon any quest, before it turned Grey in your characters quest log. Elite, dungeon or group quests are NEVER done and can be abandoned as soon as you wish.
-Keep the profile in its default folder and put it directly in the Quester folder (f.e. D:\Bot\WRobot\Profiles\Quester). Otherwise, the profile isn't able to load a following profile.
DO NOT change the name / location of any file!
-There are a few occasions, where the bot has to grind some time (in general one level up). This can be drastically reduced by resting in a city, botting only on every other day or running dungeons.
There are some quests I skipped, but will be added to get rid of grinding entirely.
-Plugins that alter the bot's path finding can cause issues / loops. Please keep that in mind.


//Recomondations:

-Only learn new spells / skills, that are mandatory for your fight class, to save gold for gear.
-Spend any gold you make in (not overpriced) auction house gear, bags and spells, that provide an upgrade for your character. 
-Discovering taxi flight paths are automated and fully scripted.
-It's not necessary to activate wRobots inbuilt taxi feature (but you are free to do so, if you want). Necessary flights are scripted and performed by the profile.
-This profile has two force breaks (three for Night Elf characters), when it is necessary to take a boat. This will happen at level 30 & level 36-37 (+ level 6 for Night Elfs). 
The automated boats feature has not been implemented yet.
-For the low performance classes, a small amount of seed money makes things a lot easier.
-To get in touch with the profile and learn how it works, choose a class with a high performance.

//Bug - problems reports

This is an overall huge project, running under drastically different circumstances. So bugs are pretty likely to occur, regardless how many runs I perform myself. 
Please make sure that a bug is not caused by a plugin, your fight class or an ingame addon, before you write a bug report and try ALWAYS provide your bots log file.
An ingame screenshot can be handy too, but is optional. 

Some quests are tricky to perform with a bot, what leads to a higher amount of deaths than usual. Examples for this are "The Coast isn't clear" or "Down the Coast".
This is especially true for classes that overall perform bad in questing (Warrior, Rogue, Mage). A high amount of deaths alone is not something I consider to be a problem, if
the bot is still making progress. But don't hesitate to report areas / quests you experienced chain dying or the bot getting stuck. 


//How to write a bug / problem report?

First of all, you can contact me via wRobot / wRobot PM, my discord Server (https://discord.gg/hM9QSq8) or E-Mail (fnv316@gmail.com).

A bug report should look like this:

Topic -> Quest you have troubles with, NPC that doesn't function, area you die a lot
Category -> F.e. Quest, script, taxi, route, miscellaneous
Urgency -> Rated from 1 (low urgency) - 5 (game breaking)
Description -> Detailed description of your problem / bug
Log file -> Attach the recorded log file, when the bug / problem occurred


EXAMPLE

Topic: Quest Peoples Militia Part 1 not turning in
Catergory: Quest
Urgency: 4
Description: The bot is not turning in 'The Peoples Militia' part 1. It's just grinding over and over the same related quests mobs, but not making any progress.
Log file: exampleLogFile.XML
